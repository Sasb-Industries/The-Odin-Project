            <p>This cheesy potato recipe begins with taking a couple potatoes to the cheese grater and making hashbrowns out of them. You can use frozen hashbrowns if you prefer to skip this step but be warned, it will not taste quite the same. Then you basicall just add an infinite amount of cream of mushroom and shredded cheese to the hash browns and mix until it's all one consistency.  Finally, top it off with some corn flakes and a little extra melted butter on top and BOOM! You have the best tasting cheesy potatoes you've ever eaten.</p>
            <p>There are a couple ingredients in this potato of cheesy goodness that you will not usually see in the more standardized makes of this food. The cream of mushroom (especially to the extent that it is used in this recipe) is something that is not usually considered when making cheesy potatoes but it absolutely makes the dish. The extra cheese is just a signature of our personal take on the cheesy potatoes recipe. The corn flakes are not an original idea brought to loght by us and I can't remember where we got the recommendation from but we have never turned back after using them.</p>
